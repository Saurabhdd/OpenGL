# OpenGL
There are in total 4 files included in project.
The source file has the executable content which includes openGL API for windows(header gl.h).
The resource file is used to add run time resources such as BITMAP files and wav files.
I have precisely not added any bitmap and wave files since there names are readable in the resource file and hence can be created by implementer as per requirement.
The Header.h is self created header file.

The project use Fixed functional pipeline of OpenGL using Windows OS. The windowing is done using WIN32.
